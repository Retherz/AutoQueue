# AutoQueue
Semi Automatically cast high priority spells (BoP &amp; PI) through whisper and key press.

Add a person  to a spell cast queue through a whispered keyword. "PI" (Power Infusion) for priest 
and "BOP" (Blessing of Protection) for paladins.

Cast the queued spell semi automatically through /script CastQueued();

Either use this as a separate macro, or bind it to your existing spells.

Example:
----------------------
```/script CastQueued();
/cast Flash of Light```
